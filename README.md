# Vending Machine
This is an exercise for my programming class.

It is limited in terms of language features that can be used and should be read with a grain of salt.
There is no error handling/exceptions, inheritance, most of the standard library is forbidden, and so on...

This is licensed with a GNU GPL 3 license, as such you can do whatever you want with the code as long as you don't sell it and keep my name in the credits.

I'll try to bundle the exercise instructions here, but not before asking its authors(my teachers) for permission. Either way, its written in Portuguese and it has a limited use for non-speakers.
Guess I can rewrite it in english, but I'm afraid I don't  have the time for that right now, and later will forget about this repo.
